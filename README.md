Income Classification
Project Description

This project focuses on predicting individuals’ income levels using machine learning techniques. The goal is to determine whether a person’s income is above or below a certain threshold based on demographic and socio-economic features.

Technologies Used

Python 3.10

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Dataset

The dataset includes information such as age, education, occupation, marital status, and working hours.
The target variable indicates whether a person’s income is >50K or <=50K.


Results

Data preprocessing steps included handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Different machine learning models were trained and evaluated.

Model performance was measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
